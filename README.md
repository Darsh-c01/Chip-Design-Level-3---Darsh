This is a package with a chip in the centre and represents how the pins in the package are connected to the chip.

This is essentially how a chip is from the inside  
>Some important terminologies here are: \
1.Pads: They are basically like doors which help the core send and recive signals \
2.Core: This is the part where all the logic gates are and the main processing happens

This is a representation of the core of the chip  
>Foundry IPs: \
 Foundy is basically the place where a chip is manufactures \
 IP = Intelectual Property

## Introduciton to RISCV
It is a instruction set architecture(ISA). \
We first write the specifications in a language like C whis is then converted to the assembly level language , which in turn is converted to an RTL.

### Flow from a app to the chip:
